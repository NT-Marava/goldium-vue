            <h4>New To Gold Mining? Guidelines to breaking into the Mining sector.</h4>

              in the country with
              an excess of 65% of gold mining deposits being controlled by small scale/artisinal miners. The major
              foreign currency income
              has been from gold exports and this largely has been from small scale and artisinal miners around the
              country.</p>

            <p>So how do you secure a mining claim legally in Zimbabwe in 2020? Here are the guidelines courtesy of the
              Mines and Minerals Act 21_05 and the
              Ministry of Mines and Mining Development.
            </p>
            <p>The Procedure</p>

            <p>1.1 Foreign Investors are permitted to possess 100% shareholding for mining tasks in all mineral aside
              from platinum and precious stones which

              the unfamiliar speculator is required to together possess with Government on a 51%/49% premise. </p>

              selects a specialist or an
            </p>
            <p>Affirmed Prospector to peg for his sake.
            </p>
            <p>1.2 The specialist is needed to genuinely peg the region by denoting the store with a Discovery Peg.
